# Solar System Project

This project is a challenge after first week of React exposure. It includes various components and a data-driven approach to render a model of the solar system.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing a model of the solar system using React. The goal is to ensure that the components are correctly implemented and render the expected output, following the requirements outlined in the project description.

## Development

The project is structured around several React components, each with a specific purpose:

- **Title:** This component is responsible for rendering the title of the page.
- **PlanetCard:** This component receives planet data as props and renders a card with the planet's name and image.
- **SolarSystem:** This is the main component of the application. It imports the `Title` and `PlanetCard` components and uses them to render a model of the solar system.

The data for the planets is stored in a separate file and imported into the `SolarSystem` component. This data-driven approach allows for easy updates to the planet data without needing to modify the components themselves.

The `SolarSystem` component is a React Class Component, which is used to manage the state and lifecycle methods of the component.

## Project Requirements

The project meets all the requirements specified in the bootcamp project readme:

1. The application must be built using React.
2. The application must use Class Components.
3. The application must use props to pass data.
4. The application must manage state and lifecycle methods.
5. The application must render a model of the solar system.
6. The application must be data-driven, with planet data stored in a separate file.
